# CICO-Check-In-Check-Out
This app is a attendance marking system or a check in check out system which allows you to mark the attendance from a hand held device that is your mobile phone. To avoid cheating while marking attendance this app have a special feature. 

GPS BASED CICO SYSTEM USING FACE RECOGNITION

ABSTRACT
This is a project for the purpose of entry-exit/ check in-check out system for marking the attendance of employees/ visitors/ students. This system will be based on the face recognition using machine learning/ image processing.
The existing check in-check out systems are not restricted to a specific region. They are restricted due to location and physically confined. RFID system is also in place but there are chances of exchange of RFID card. In proposed system, a person will be checked-in or checked-out by face recognition in specified GPS region only.
In this system an employee of an organization can gets the attendance by face recognition from his designated office only. It will be very helpful in tracking of employees in online mode (work from home) or offline mode.

INTRODUCTION
The project is an entry-exit system using face recognition in a GPS specified area. This project will use machine learning/ image processing and GPS API. This will be helpful in tracking and monitoring the employees.

MOTIVATION
During the pandemic many people were allowed to work from home online but they were moving cities to cities, I reviewed my own relatives, neighbors and other people for the same issue that they never worked from a particular place. Lots of companies invested a lot on the employees to increase their productivity from home but they were not working from a particular place or not working with a peace of mind that effects their productivity and performance.

REVIEW

Manual system:
In manual system, registers are used. The employees have to mark their attendance manually.

Weakness:
Wastage of time.
Long queue.
Manual.
Putting wrong time.
Tracking.
Monitoring.

RFID system (Radio frequency ID system):
Each employee is provided a RFID card that contains an antenna in it. It marks the attendance of the employee using RFID reader.

Weakness:
Chances of card exchange.
Fake attendance.
Long queue.
Waste of time.
Not so successful in market.

Face recognition System:
A machine and a camera are installed that recognizes the faces of employee and marks their attendance.
Weakness:
Shortage of machines.
Long queues.
Costly.

Thumb impression:
Machine marks the thumb impression of employees and marks their attendance.

Weakness:
Long queue.
Costly.
A computer is required.
Chances of duplicacy of thumb. 

On the basis of above review, we are going to propose a face recognition-based GPS restricted CICO system that overcome all the above difficulties of the existing systems.
In addition to that, implementation of the product is cost effective, no wastage of time because attendance can be marked with a hand-held device like mobile phone.
No additional hardware is required. But such system might be having a shortcoming of check-in from home or any other place so to avoid this GPS domain restricted system will resolve this issue. 

Advantages:
Monitoring and control of employee will be easy.
No long queue.
No exchange of ID cards.
No wastage of time.
No duplicacy.
Cost effective.

TECHOLOGIES TO BE USED
Android Java development.
Python/ PHP.
Database – MySQL.
Face recognition and face detection frameworks.

CONCLUSION
Using all the above-mentioned technologies the app will be developed. This will use web app development and android app development. I wish and pray that a good solution will be developed finally.
